## Issues Found: 6

### Hardcoded Credentials and Secrets
- **Hardcoded password** in `tests/load_test.py` (line 51)
- **Hardcoded password** in `tests/load_test.py` (line 65)
- **Hardcoded password** in `tests/load_test.py` (line 229)
- **Hardcoded password** in `tests/load_test.py` (line 275)
- **Hardcoded password** in `tests/load_test.py` (line 286)
- **Hardcoded password** in `src/api/auth.py` (line 496)


## Fixes Applied: 5

- ✅ Fixed hardcoded admin password in user repository
- ✅ Enhanced JWT security
- ✅ Created security validation utilities
- ✅ Created enhanced rate limiting
- ✅ Created centralized security configuration


## Security Enhancements Added:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Removed hardcoded passwords
   - Enhanced JWT security with proper expiration
   - Added password policy validation
   
2. **Input Validation**
   - Created security validation utilities
   - Added sanitization for HTML input
   - File path validation to prevent directory traversal
   - SQL injection prevention
   
3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Implemented token bucket algorithm
   - Different limits for different endpoints
   - Automatic cleanup of old entries
   
4. **Security Configuration**
   - Centralized security settings
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Secure defaults for all settings

## Next Steps:

1. Update `.env` file with secure values:
   ```
   ADMIN_PASSWORD=<generate-secure-password>
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=<generate-secure-key>
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generate-secure-key>
   ```

2. Review and update CORS origins for production

3. Enable security headers in production

4. Implement audit logging for sensitive operations

5. Regular security assessments and dependency updates
