# Advanced AI Agent Architecture Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the comprehensive Advanced AI Agent Architecture that combines Finite State Machines (FSM), ReAct (Reasoning and Acting), and Chain of Thought (CoT) approaches into a unified, production-ready system.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Data Structures

#### AgentState
Represents the current state of an agent with data, confidence, and timestamp.

```python
@dataclass
class AgentState:
    name: str
    data: Dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    confidence: float = 1.0
    timestamp: float = field(default_factory=time.time)
```

#### Transition
Represents state transitions with conditions, probabilities, and actions.

```python
@dataclass
class Transition:
    from_state: str
    to_state: str
    condition: Callable
    probability: float = 1.0
    action: Optional[Callable] = None
```

#### ReasoningStep
Represents individual steps in chain of thought reasoning.

```python
@dataclass
class ReasoningStep:
    step_id: int
    thought: str
    action: Optional[str] = None
    observation: Optional[str] = None
    confidence: float = 1.0
```

### 2. Enhanced FSM Implementation

#### ProbabilisticFSM
Advanced FSM with probabilistic transitions and learning capabilities.

**Key Features:**
- Probabilistic transition selection
- Learning from successful transitions
- State and transition history tracking
- Adaptive behavior based on performance

**Usage:**
```python
fsm = ProbabilisticFSM("my_fsm")

# Add states
fsm.add_state(AgentState("idle", {"energy": 100}))
fsm.add_state(AgentState("working", {"task": None}))

# Add transitions
fsm.add_transition(Transition(
    "idle", "working",
    lambda s: s.data.get("energy", 0) > 50,
    probability=0.9
))

# Run FSM
fsm.set_initial_state("idle")
while fsm.step():
    # Process state changes
    pass
```

#### HierarchicalFSM
Extends ProbabilisticFSM with parent-child relationships for complex behaviors.

**Features:**

**Usage:**
```python
tools = [SemanticSearchTool(), PythonInterpreter()]
react_agent = ReActAgent("my_react", tools)

# Execute parallel reasoning
paths = await react_agent.parallel_reasoning(
    query="Analyze this problem",
    context={"domain": "AI"},
    num_paths=3
)

# Select best path
best_path = max(paths, key=lambda p: sum(s.confidence for s in p))
```

### 4. Optimized Chain of Thought

#### ChainOfThought
Optimized CoT with adaptive depth and caching.

**Features:**

# Access complexity analysis
complexity = cot.analyze_complexity("Complex query here")
```

#### ComplexityAnalyzer
Analyzes query complexity to determine reasoning depth.

#### TemplateLibrary
Provides reasoning templates for different query types.

### 5. Unified Hybrid Architecture

#### HybridAgent
Unified agent that combines FSM, ReAct, and CoT approaches.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic mode selection based on task type
- Performance tracking and optimization
- Integration with existing FSMReActAgent
- Adaptive behavior based on success rates

**Usage:**
```python
# Create hybrid agent
agent = HybridAgent("my_agent", tools)

# Execute tasks (mode selection is automatic)
result = await agent.execute_task({
    "type": "reasoning",
    "query": "Analyze this problem"
})

# Check performance metrics
print(agent.mode_performance)
```

**Mode Selection Logic:**
- `fsm`: Navigation and state-based tasks
- `react`: Tool use and external interaction
- `cot`: Reasoning and analysis
- `fsm_react`: Complex tasks and GAIA benchmarks

### 6. Multi-Agent Collaboration

#### MultiAgentSystem
Orchestrates collaboration between multiple agents.

**Features:**
- Agent registry and capability matching
- Shared memory for inter-agent communication
- Parallel task execution
- Result aggregation

**Usage:**
```python
system = MultiAgentSystem()

# Add agents with capabilities
system.add_agent(general_agent, ["general", "search"])
system.add_agent(analysis_agent, ["reasoning", "analysis"])

# Execute collaborative task
result = await system.collaborate_on_task({
    "type": "complex",
    "subtasks": [
        {"type": "reasoning", "required_capability": "reasoning"},
        {"type": "search", "required_capability": "search"}
    ]
})
```

#### AgentRegistry
Manages agent discovery and capability matching.

#### SharedMemory
Provides inter-agent communication and data sharing.

### 7. Emergent Behavior System

#### EmergentBehaviorEngine
Enables agents to discover and evolve new behaviors.

**Features:**
- Behavior pattern observation

**Usage:**
```python
engine = EmergentBehaviorEngine()

# Observe agent behavior
engine.observe_behavior(agent, task, result, success=True)

# Analyze patterns
engine.analyze_patterns()

# Evolve behaviors
evolved_behavior = engine.evolve_behavior(agent, original_behavior)
```

### 8. Performance Optimization

#### PerformanceOptimizer
Optimizes agent performance through caching and prediction.

**Features:**
- Result caching
- Task prediction
- Resource monitoring
- Precomputation

**Usage:**
```python
optimizer = PerformanceOptimizer()

# Optimize execution
cached_result = optimizer.optimize_execution(agent, task)

# Monitor resources
usage = optimizer.resource_monitor.get_usage_summary()
```

#### ResultCache
Caches task results for improved performance.

#### TaskPredictor
Predicts likely next tasks based on patterns.

#### ResourceMonitor
Monitors and optimizes resource usage.

## Integration with Existing Codebase

### FSMReActAgent Integration
The hybrid architecture integrates seamlessly with the existing FSMReActAgent:

```python
# HybridAgent automatically uses FSMReActAgent for complex tasks
agent = HybridAgent("my_agent", tools)

# For complex or GAIA tasks, it automatically uses FSMReActAgent
result = await agent.execute_task({
    "type": "gaia",
    "query": "How many birds are in the video?"
})
```

### Tool Integration
Uses existing BaseTool structure:

```python
from src.tools.semantic_search_tool import SemanticSearchTool
from src.tools.python_interpreter import PythonInterpreter

tools = [SemanticSearchTool(), PythonInterpreter()]
agent = HybridAgent("my_agent", tools)
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

# Create system
system = AdvancedHybridSystem()

# Create agents
general_agent = system.create_agent("general", tools, ["general", "search"])
reasoning_agent = system.create_agent("reasoning", tools, ["reasoning", "analysis"])

# Execute complex task
result = await system.execute_complex_task({
    "type": "complex",
    "query": "Analyze hybrid AI architectures",
    "subtasks": [
        {"type": "reasoning", "required_capability": "reasoning"},
        {"type": "search", "required_capability": "search"}
    ]
})
```

### FSM Learning Example

# Add transitions
fsm.add_transition(Transition(
    "idle", "working",
    lambda s: s.data.get("energy", 0) > 50,
    probability=0.8
))

# Run and learn
fsm.set_initial_state("idle")
for _ in range(10):
    fsm.step()

print(f"Learned transitions: {fsm.learned_transitions}")
```

### Chain of Thought Example
