# 🚀 AI Agent - Quick Start Guide

Your directory has been cleaned and organized! Here's how to use your AI Agent system:

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
AI-Agent/
├── _active/           # Currently active components
│   └── saas-platform/ # Your SaaS web interface
├── src/              # Core source code
├── tests/            # Test suites
├── _archive/         # Archived development files
└── venv/            # Python virtual environment
```

## 🎯 Running the SaaS Platform

The easiest way to use your AI Agent:

```bash
cd _active/saas-platform
./run_simple.sh
```

Then open: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🛑 Stopping Services

```bash
cd _active/saas-platform
./stop_saas.sh
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **Main README**: `README.md`
- **SaaS Platform Guide**: `_active/saas-platform/README_SAAS.md`
- **Directory Structure**: `DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`

## 🧹 What Was Cleaned

- ✅ Moved temporary files to `_archive/old_files/`
- ✅ Consolidated multiple startup scripts
- ✅ Organized documentation files
- ✅ Archived unused examples and scripts
- ✅ Removed Python cache files
- ✅ Created clear directory structure

## 💡 Tips

1. Your SaaS platform is fully functional in `_active/saas-platform/`
2. All old files are safely stored in `_archive/` if you need them
3. The core AI agent code remains in `src/`
4. Tests are still available in `tests/`

Enjoy your clean, organized AI Agent system!
